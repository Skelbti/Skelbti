# About Me
Hi, I’m a French PhD Student in musicology at Sorbonne Université, Paris.
I use programming to help me in my research and musicological analysis. I am a novice and self-taught in programming. I am particularly interested in Data Science in the musicological field.
## Skills
Most of the time I use Python for my projects. I use a lot the package [music21](https://github.com/cuthbertLab/music21) for musicological projects.
I have some notions in C++ and HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
## I’m looking for…
- I am searching for a way to create and manipulate SVG file with Python.
- I’m looking for Python module to handle real time musical projects.
